We experimentally evaluate our verified validation algorithm and show that it is practical.},

Among proof assistant libraries, it is distinguished by its dependently typed foundations, focus on classical mathematics, extensive hierarchy of structures, use of large- and small-scale automation, and distributed organization. We explain the architecture and design decisions of the library and the social organization that has led to its development.},
