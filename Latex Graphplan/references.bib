  abstract  = {This paper describes mathlib, a community-driven effort to build a unified library of mathematics formalized in the Lean proof assistant. Among proof assistant libraries, it is distinguished by its dependently typed foundations, focus on classical mathematics, extensive hierarchy of structures, use of large- and small-scale automation, and distributed organization. We explain the architecture and design decisions of the library and the social organization that has led to its development.},
